      in 1634, Boston Common is America’s oldest public park. Puritan colonists
      purchased the land rights to the Common’s 44 acres from the first European
      settler of the area, Anglican minister William Blackstone.


      As you can see, almost everything is behind something else.

      Shaw/54th Massachusetts Regiment Memorial, sculpted in bas-relief by
      Augustus Saint-Gaudens, commemorates the first all-Black volunteer
      regiment in the Civil War. Shaw and many of his men perished in their
      assault of Fort Wagner in South Carolina. William Carney, who was wounded
      in the assault, rescued the regiment’s battle flag and became the first
      black man to earn the Congressional Medal of Honor.


      It is almost impossible to see the individual soldiers because of the
      horse's butt, but that's war for you.

      atop the site of Boston’s town grain storage building, or granary.
      Designed by Peter Banner, the 217 ft. steeple of Park Street Church was
      once the first landmark travelers saw when approaching Boston.


      This classic nostril shot of the Church is gratefully unobscured, one of
      the few in this tour.

      Established in 1660, some of America's most notable citizens rest here.
      Named for the 12,000-bushel grain storage building that was once next
      door, the historic burying ground has approximately 2,300 markers.


      The snaggletooth tombstones of this rather unkempt cemetery are too worn
      to tell who lies there, in most cases. Time obscures all.

      Founded in 1686 as Boston’s first Anglican church, King’s Chapel is home
      to over 330 years of history. The 1754 granite building still stands on
      the church’s original site: the corner of Boston’s oldest English burying
      ground. Boston is all about its burying grounds.


      As you can see, tourists and street signs sap this amazing site of its
      full glory. Why can't we have nice things?

      a multitude of illustrious residents, including John Winthrop,
      Massachusetts’ first Governor, and Mary Chilton, the first woman to step
      off the Mayflower.


      Another burying ground festooned with placards and tourists. We shooed

      Boston Latin School, founded on April 23, 1635, is the oldest public
      school in America. It offered free education to boys - rich or poor -
      while girls attended private schools at home. Until the completion of the
      schoolhouse in 1645, classes were held in the home of the first
      headmaster, Philemon Pormont.


      As you can see, hopscotch was WAYYY more complicated in ye olde times.

      Constructed in 1718, the Old Corner Bookstore is downtown Boston’s oldest
      commercial building and was home to the 19th-century publishing giant
      Ticknor and Fields, producer of many venerable American titles including
      Thoreau’s Walden, Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, Longfellow's Midnight
      Ride of Paul Revere, and the Atlantic Monthly including Ward Howe's Battle
      Hymn of the Republic. Saved from demolition in 1960, the building’s leases
      help subsidize important historic preservation projects in Boston’s
      neighborhoods.


      Nothing obscures the past like modern capitalism. Chipotle may be
      delicious, but it scarcely represents the forefront of historic
      preservation.

      Often referred to as "the home of free speech" and the "Cradle of
      Liberty," Faneuil Hall hosted America's first Town Meeting. The Hall's
      vital role in revolutionary politics had not been part of its original
      plans, but it became home to an intricate collection of events that shaped
      the nation's history.


      Faneuil Hall has a grand reputation, but behind the buses, cars, people
      and signs, there is a strange little square building, as you can see. You
      would think they would celebrate the enormous market behind this building,
      but Boston is an odd duck.

      Built around 1680, the Paul Revere House, owned by the legendary patriot
      from 1770-1800, is the oldest remaining structure in downtown Boston and
      also the only official Freedom Trail historic site that is a home.

      Built in 1723, Boston’s oldest church is best known for the midnight ride
      of Paul Revere and “One if by land, two if by sea.”

      Launched in Boston in 1797, USS Constitution is the oldest commissioned
      warship afloat and earned her nickname "Old Ironsides" during the War of
      1812 when she fought the British frigate HMS Guerriere.


      Needless to say, this might be the most obscured destination on the tour.
      Water, masts, buildings...almost impossible to see.

      Revolutionary War hero Marquis De Lafayette on the 50th anniversary of the

A tour of the densest concentrations of tourists in Boston, focused on the thin red line that runs through Boston's iconic destinations obscured by various things, most often.

The critical importance of avoiding dehydration led to the Great Hydration Event of 2024, seen here in its glory (Chelsea was totally there, taking the photo. Don't let her deny it.)
