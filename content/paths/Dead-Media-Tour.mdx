      This shop is where to go for crystals, new age books, and psychedelic
      ephemera. Surprisingly, they had a terrific (although small) selection of
      children's picture books.

      On the ground floor you'll find a lovely eclectic selection of puzzles,
      games, dice (including hundred-sided dice!), and pride pins. Venturing
      downstairs, you descend into a spacious, multi-room basement that includes
      an event space (during our visit, it was abuzz with dozens of Magic: the
      Gathering players engaged in a [Bloomburrow prerelease event](<>
      "bloomburrow")), as well as a deep and well-curated selection of both
      classic and contemporary speculative fiction, for both YA and adult
      readers.

      Featuring attractive neon signage in a brick building on Mass Ave in
      Cambridge, Cheapo Records is a well-organized used and new record store
      with a focus on vinyl, also stocking CDs and cassettes. It also has a
      small selection of DVDs, books, and music posters. And a laserdisc
      section! If you’re in need of record players or other audio equipment,
      these are also available.

    blurb: >
      A few doors down from its original location, Newbury Comics on Newbury St.
      is a three-story behemoth of nerd-oriented consumer goods. Though New
      Englanders will know just how widely this chain has expanded, its flagship
      store’s size allows it to expand its selection past the typical mall
      location. If you make it past the wall of Funko Pop figurines at the
      front, you can explore a basement entirely full of new vinyl records and
      CDs and an upstairs oriented towards comics.![](/src/assets/IMG_7898.jpg)

    blurb: >
      Trident primarily sells new books and has a café with indoor and outdoor
      seating. They host many community-focused events, from open mic nights and
      write-ins to queer speed-dating and trivia or D\&D nights, as well as more
      traditional author events. They even sell some merch! Come here for a
      great range of books that span two levels, good food, and community.

    blurb: >
      A gorgeous chalk drawing of Spider-Gwen proclaiming PROTECT TRANS KIDS
      sets the vibe as you enter this bright and welcoming comic shop. Inside,
      passing a wall festooned with stickers such as "Come in, we're gay!", you
      will find shelves lined with all sorts of comics and manga. The selection
      of manga is particularly noteworthy, including several shelves of queer
      comics, both fiction and nonfiction. My own favorite shelf is one
      dedicated to learning Japanese through manga, with a curated selection of
      beginner-friendly volumes.

    blurb: >
      Disco music flooding the neighborhood through an outdoor loudspeaker, a
      70s slab serif “NUGGETS” logo adorning a clock outside, and a large
      printed sign advertising all manner of physical media bought and sold will
      attract the retro-minded consumer. Located inside an old stone building
      along the Commonwealth Avenue greenway, this store features a wide
      selection of rare and unusual music, full of surprising nooks and
      crannies, and the pleasantly musty smell of old
      records.![](/src/assets/IMG_7886.jpg)

    blurb: >
      We were heralded into Friar Tuck's by a friendly crier greeting us on the
      sidewalk and urging us to check it out. The store is tucked (ha) at the
      top of a staircase, and truly makes the most of its one relatively small
      room: There are a few tables wedged between the boxes and boxes of vintage
      collectible comics and obscure nerdy swag, which can be used as an event
      space for hosting recurring events such as Pokémon leagues and *Magic: the
      Gathering* games. Somehow I managed to avoid the temptation to leave the
      shop carrying several vintage *Star Trek: TNG *collectible dinner plates
      and a popcorn popper shaped like a Pokéball.

    blurb: >
      We saved Brookline Booksmith for the final stop because this is a place
      where you'll want to linger. There's a wonderful selection of new and used
      books that span multiple levels, terrific author events, and a wide range
      of home goods and merch. Although Booksmith doesn't have fresh food, the
      neighborhood has plenty of restaurants and cafés where you can head
      afterwards.
